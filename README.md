# A Sunset Rendezvous
**Move with WASD or Arrow Keys.  Fire with Spacebar.**

Assignment was to create a topdown level in the style of the original Zelda.  Level features a health system and HUD to display it, basic combat & enemy patrol systems, and a key that must be obtained to unlock the end goal.  Created before I knew about Unity tilemaps, so each tile is a separate GameObject -- 0/10 method, do not recommend.
